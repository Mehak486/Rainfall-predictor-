## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters weather details (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
2. Data is processed using a trained machine learning model
3. The system predicts whether rainfall will occur
4. A **voice alert** announces the prediction result
5. Output is displayed clearly on the interface
